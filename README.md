# Project--Library-Management-System

##1.1 Introduction##
Library Management System is an interactive software application designed to automate library operations. It offers an organized and effective solution to problems with book management, user administration, and transaction tracking.
##1.2 Motivation##
Manual library management often leads to inefficiencies, such as difficulty in tracking issued books, overdue penalties, and book reservations. This project eliminates these issues by introducing a systematic,
digital approach.
##1.3 Objectives##
 Design a computerized way to manage books and users.
 Make it easy to operate for a library staff with an understanding interface.
 Errors and manual work could be done away with and system reliability made better.
##1.4 Feasibility Study##
Various library management software solutions were studied. The proposed system is different in that it will provide the flexibility, customizable features, and a simpler interface to meet the specific needs of small to mid-sized libraries.
##1.5 Gap Analysis##
1.Lack of integrated book reservation queues for issued books.
2.Limited to single-user or admin centric functionalities.
3.Lack of integration between book management, penalties, and user transactions.
4.Paper-based systems or inefficient digital systems dominate.
##1.6 Project Outcome##
The system aims to:
 Manage books, users, and transactions efficiently.
 Provide automated solutions for issuing, returning, and reserving books.
 Maintain an accurate record of penalties and overdue statuses.
